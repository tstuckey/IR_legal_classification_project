# Classifying US Supreme Court Legal Opinions

This project focuses primarily on developing model(s) to classify these Supreme Court legal opinions and secondarily on presenting some rudimentary information with regard to the President and political party responsible for appointing the justice presenting the legal opinion.

Classification is accomplished with Support Vector Machines (SVM) using the [SVM-Light](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/svm_light/) implementation.
